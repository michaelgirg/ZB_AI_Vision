# Production-v2 AXI4-Lite Register Map

This is the implemented register contract of `axis_preprocess_vector_axi_lite`
and `axis_preprocess_vector_cdc`. The bus is 32 bits wide, little-endian, and
word aligned. Existing offsets remain stable; v2 discovery, diagnostics,
counters, and interrupts occupy previously unused space beginning at `0x70`.

## Access rules

- `RW`: readable and writable; only asserted `WSTRB` byte lanes change.
- `RO`: writes return `SLVERR` and have no side effect.
- `WO`: reads return zero with `SLVERR`.
- `W1C`: writing a one clears that bit; writing zero preserves it.
- A legal write with `WSTRB=0` is an `OKAY` no-op.
- Unmapped or misaligned accesses return `SLVERR`.
- Configuration and start/commit writes are rejected with `SLVERR` while a
  frame is active. Diagnostic W1C, interrupt-enable, and counter-clear writes
  remain legal while busy.

| `0x68` | `VECTOR_CFG_COMMIT` | WO | `0` | bit 0 atomically commits all shadow entries while idle |
| `0x6C` | `VECTOR_CFG_VERSION` | RO | `0` | increments after each accepted commit |
| `0x70` | `IP_ID` | RO | `0x5A424156` | ASCII `ZBAV` |

| `0x98` | `PERF_CONTROL` | WO | `0` | bit 0 clears all four saturating counters |

Frame dimensions remain compile-time parameters in v2. Runtime width/height
registers are intentionally deferred because every current line buffer is sized
for a fixed frame geometry.

## Indirect vector configuration

`VECTOR_CFG_INDEX[5:4]` selects filter 0-3. The entry field means:

| Entry | Data encoding |
| ---: | --- |
| 0-8 | signed INT8 kernel tap in `VECTOR_CFG_DATA[7:0]` |
| 9 | signed INT32 bias |
| 10 | shift in `[4:0]`, ReLU enable in bit 8 |

Writes update only the shadow bank. `VECTOR_CFG_COMMIT.bit0` copies all shadow
entries to the committed bank in one idle cycle. `CTRL.start` snapshots the
committed bank into active state, so later shadow writes cannot alter an
in-flight frame.

## Capability bits

`CAPABILITIES = 0x000F044F`:

| Bits | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `[3:0]` | mode support bitmap; all four modes implemented |
| `[7:4]` | four vector filters |
| `[15:8]` | four AXI-Stream data bytes |
| `16` | atomic vector configuration commit |
| `17` | per-byte WSTRB preservation |
| `18` | AXI `SLVERR` response policy |
| `19` | counters and interrupt controller |

## Error and interrupt bits

`ERROR_STATUS`:

| Bit | Cause |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | completed frame reported a packet-format error |
| 1 | AXI-Lite write was rejected |
| 2 | AXI-Lite read was rejected |

`INT_STATUS` and `INT_ENABLE` share this encoding:

| Bit | Cause |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | frame completed |
| 1 | packet error |
| 2 | rejected AXI-Lite read or write |

`irq` is level-sensitive and equals `|(INT_STATUS & INT_ENABLE)`. Event set has
priority over a same-cycle W1C clear, preventing a newly arriving cause from
being lost.

## Software sequence

1. Confirm `IP_ID`, compatible `IP_VERSION`, and required capability bits.
2. Program mode and mode-specific shadow configuration while idle.
3. Commit vector configuration when using mode 3.
4. Clear stale `ERROR_STATUS` and `INT_STATUS`; enable desired interrupts.
5. Write `CTRL.start` and transfer exactly `IMAGE_PIXELS` input beats with
   `TLAST` on the final accepted beat.
6. Wait for IRQ or poll `STATUS.done`.
7. Read status, counters, and processing cycles; W1C handled causes.

For the CDC wrapper, assertion of either external reset flushes both synchronized
bridge halves. Software must not expect an outstanding AXI-Lite transaction to
survive either reset assertion; begin new accesses only after both domains have
deasserted reset and completed synchronization. Each reset assertion must remain
active long enough to be sampled by the opposite clock domain's two-stage reset
status synchronizer; four cycles of the slower clock is the verification rule.
